        <p>Etymology The English word "news" developed in the 14th century as a special use of the plural form of "new". In Middle English, the equivalent word was newes, like the French nouvelles and the German Neues. Similar developments are found in the
            Slavic languages – namely the Czech and Slovak noviny (from nový, "new"), the cognate Polish nowiny, the Bulgarian novini, and Russian novosti – and in the Celtic languages: the Welsh newyddion (from newydd) and the Cornish nowodhow (from
            nowydh).[1][2] The beliefs that "news" is derived from an acronym of the phrase “Notable Events, Weather, and Sports”, or that it is formed from the first letters of the compass (North, East, West, South) are incorrect.[3] Jessica Garretson
            Finch is credited with coining the phrase "current events" while teaching at Barnard College in the 1890s.[4] Newness As its name implies, "news" typically connotes the presentation of new information.[5][6] The newness of news gives it an
            uncertain quality which distinguishes it from the more careful investigations of history or other scholarly disciplines.[6][7][8] Whereas historians tend to view events as causally related Manifestations of underlying processes, news stories
            tend to describe events in isolation, and to exclude discussion of the relationships between them.[9] News conspicuously describes the world in the present or immediate past, even when the most important aspects of a news story have occurred
            long in the past—or are expected to occur in the future. To make the news, an ongoing process must have some "peg", an event in time which anchors it to the present moment.[9][10] Relatedly, news often addresses aspects of reality which seem
            unusual, deviant, or out of the ordinary.[11] Hence the famous dictum that "Dog Bites Man" is not news, but "Man Bites Dog" is.[12] Another corollary of the newness of news is that, as new technology enables new media to disseminate news more
            quickly, 'slower' forms of communication may move away from 'news' towards 'analysis'.[13] Commodity According to some theories, "news" is whatever the news industry sells.[14] Journalism, broadly understood along the same lines, is the act
            or occupation of collecting and providing news.[15][16] From a commercial perspective, news is simply one input, along with paper (or an electronic server) necessary to prepare a final product for distribution.[17] A news agency supplies this
            resource "wholesale" and publishers enhance it for retail.[18][19] Tone Most purveyors of news value impartiality, neutrality, and objectivity, despite the inherent difficulty of reporting without political bias.[20] Perception of these values
            has changed greatly over time as sensationalized 'tabloid journalism' has risen in popularity. Michael Schudson has argued that before the era of World War I and the concomitant rise of propaganda, journalists were not aware of the concept
            of bias in reporting, let alone actively correcting for it.[21] News is also sometimes said to portray the truth, but this relationship is elusive and qualified.[22] Paradoxically, another property commonly attributed to news is sensationalism,
            the disproportionate focus on, and exaggeration of, emotive stories for public consumption.[23][24] This news is also not unrelated to gossip, the human practice of sharing information about other humans of mutual interest.[25] A common sensational
            topic is violence; hence another news dictum, "if it bleeds, it leads".[26] Newsworthiness Newsworthiness is defined as a subject having sufficient relevance to the public or a special audience to warrant press attention or coverage.[27] News
            values seem to be common across cultures. People seem to be interested in news to the extent which it has a big impact, describes conflicts, happens nearby, involves well-known people, and deviates from the norms of everyday happenings.[28]
            War is a common news topic, partly because it involves unknown events that could pose personal danger.[29]
